/*
	output_atoms	(list of atoms)		The destination(s) for the sounds
	mid_sounds		(list or soundfile)	Sound to play over and over -- if its a list, use this format: list(SOUND_LOOP_ENTRY('sound/file.ogg', length_in_deciseconds, chance_weight), SOUND_LOOP_ENTRY('sound/file.ogg', length_in_deciseconds, chance_weight))
	mid_length		(num)				The length to wait between playing mid_sounds -- only used if mid_sounds is NOT a list!
	loop_delay		(num)				Delay between attempts to play a sound. if 0, it tries to play immediately after the sound ends
	start_sound		(soundfile)			Played before starting the mid_sounds loop
	start_length	(num)				How long to wait before starting the main loop after playing start_sound
	end_sound		(soundfile)			The sound played after the main loop has concluded
	chance			(num)				Chance per loop to play a mid_sound
	volume			(num or list)		Sound output volume
	max_loops		(num)				The max amount of loops to run for.
	direct			(bool)				If true plays directly to provided atoms instead of from them
