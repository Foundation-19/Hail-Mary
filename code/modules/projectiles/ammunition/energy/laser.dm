/* here are the ammo sizes since nobody ever wrote these down
electron chargepack = 2500, this is currently only used in the RCW Changed by ZNA because multiple of 2's is ass for math. It'll calm down the weird ass decimals.
mfc = 2000
ec = 1500 Changed by ZNA because multiple of 2's is ass for math. It'll calm down the weird ass decimals.

each one goes up by 4,000 power. why? nobody fucking knows lmao

also: most hitscan weapons have more charge than their normal projectile counterparts, since the actual projectiles are lower in damage and AP. this is to represent spammability.
